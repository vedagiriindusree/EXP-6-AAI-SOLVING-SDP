# Exp - 6(AAI) - Solving a Stochastic Grid-World Markov Decision Process Using Value Iteration and Policy Iteration
## By Vedagiri Indu Sree Reg no:212223230236
A compact Python implementation of two dynamic-programming methods for solving a stochastic grid-world Markov decision process (MDP):

- **Value Iteration**
- **Policy Iteration**

The program calculates the utility of each state and prints the resulting greedy policy.

## Why sequential decision problems matter

A **sequential decision problem** is one in which a decision made now affects what choices, rewards, and risks are available later. The objective is not simply to choose the action with the best immediate result; it is to choose actions that lead to the best *long-term* outcome despite uncertainty.

This grid world is a small example: moving toward the goal may be worthwhile, but a movement can drift unexpectedly toward the trap. The agent must therefore balance the immediate step cost, the chance of reaching the reward, and the risk of a future penalty.

Solving problems like this is important because many real systems operate through a sequence of connected decisions:

- **Robotics and navigation:** choosing safe routes while accounting for imperfect movement and obstacles.
- **Operations and logistics:** planning inventory, deliveries, and resources when demand and travel conditions are uncertain.
- **Finance:** weighing current returns against longer-term risk and future market outcomes.
- **Healthcare:** selecting treatments over time as a patient's condition and response evolve.
- **Reinforcement learning:** training an agent to act effectively from feedback rather than fixed instructions.

Value iteration and policy iteration provide principled ways to solve a Markov decision process (MDP). They evaluate both immediate rewards and expected future utility, producing a policy that tells an agent what action to take in each state. This makes them foundational techniques for planning under uncertainty.

## Mathematical formulation


| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| s| Current state |
| a | Action selected in state \(s\) |
| s'| Possible successor (next) state |
| R(s) | Immediate reward in state \(s\) |
| P(s' \| s, a) | Probability of reaching \(s'\) after taking \(a\) in \(s\). The vertical bar \| means “given.” |
| γ | Discount factor, which controls how much future rewards matter relative to immediate rewards. In this program, γ = 1.0. |

### Bellman optimality equation

The optimal utility of a state is its immediate reward plus the discounted expected utility of the best available action:

$$
V^{\star}(s) = R(s) + \gamma \max_{a \in A(s)} \sum_{s'} P(s' \mid s, a)V^{*}(s')
$$

### Value iteration update

Value iteration repeatedly applies the Bellman optimality update until successive utility values change by less than the chosen tolerance:

$$
V_{k+1}(s) = R(s) + \gamma \max_{a \in A(s)} \sum_{s'} P(s' \mid s, a)V_k(s')
$$

For this program, an intended action succeeds with probability \(0.8\), while the agent drifts left or right with probability \(0.1\) each. Therefore, the expected successor utility is:

$$
\sum_{s'} P(s' \mid s, a)V(s') =
0.8V(s_{\text{intended}}) +
0.1V(s_{\text{left}}) +
0.1V(s_{\text{right}})
$$

### Arbitrary initial policy

Policy iteration begins with any valid action at each non-terminal state:

$$
\pi_0(s) \in A(s), \quad \forall s \notin \text{Terminal States}
$$

This implementation initializes the policy with `UP` for every non-terminal state.

### Policy evaluation

For a fixed policy \(\pi\), the utility of each state is calculated as:

$$
V^{\pi}(s) = R(s) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s' \mid s, \pi(s))V^{\pi}(s')
$$

### Policy improvement

The policy is improved by selecting the action with the largest expected successor utility:

$$
\pi_{\text{new}}(s) =
\arg\max_{a \in A(s)}
\sum_{s'} P(s' \mid s, a)V^{\pi}(s')
$$

Policy evaluation and improvement repeat until the policy does not change:

$$
\pi_{\text{new}} = \pi
$$

## Grid-world configuration

The environment is a 3 × 4 grid:

```text
+-------+-------+-------+--------+
| (2,0) | (2,1) | (2,2) | Goal   |
+-------+-------+-------+--------+
| (1,0) | Block | (1,2) | Trap   |
+-------+-------+-------+--------+
| (0,0) | (0,1) | (0,2) | (0,3)  |
+-------+-------+-------+--------+
```

| Element | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Normal-state reward | `-0.04` |
| Goal at `(2, 3)` | terminal state with reward `+1.0` |
| Trap at `(1, 3)` | terminal state with reward `-1.0` |
| Blocked cell | `(1, 1)` |
| Discount factor | `γ = 1.0` |
| Convergence threshold | `ε = 1e-4` |

Coordinates use `(row, column)` with `(0, 0)` at the bottom-left. The displayed arrays are flipped vertically so the top row appears first.

## Movement model

The available actions are `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT`.

An intended action succeeds with probability **0.8**. With probability **0.1** each, the agent drifts to the action on its left or right. If a move would leave the grid or enter the blocked cell, the agent stays in its current state.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- NumPy

Install the dependency:

```bash
python3 -m pip install numpy
```

## Run

```bash
python3 valuePolicyIter.py
```

By default, the script runs value iteration and prints a utility table followed by the extracted policy.

Example output:

```text
--- Final Utility Table ---
[[ 0.812  0.868  0.918  1.   ]
 [ 0.762  0.796  0.66  -1.   ]
 [ 0.705  0.655  0.611  0.388]]

--- Extracted Policy Layout ---
[['RIGHT' 'RIGHT' 'RIGHT' 'GOAL']
 ['UP' 'UP' 'UP' 'TRAP']
 ['UP' 'LEFT' 'LEFT' 'LEFT']]
```

### Value iteration (default)

```python
U, policy = value_iteration(gamma, epsilon)
```

Value iteration repeatedly applies the Bellman optimality update until the largest utility change is smaller than `epsilon`.

### Policy iteration

Comment out the value-iteration line and enable this one:

```python
U, policy = policy_iteration(gamma, epsilon)
```

Policy iteration alternates between evaluating the current policy and improving it until no action changes.

## Customize the environment

Edit these values near the top of the script to experiment with other MDPs:

- `rows`, `cols` — grid size
- `R` — reward table
- `terminals` — terminal-state coordinates
- `gamma` — discount factor
- `epsilon` — stopping tolerance
- `get_next_state()` — boundaries and blocked-cell behavior
- `get_action_distribution()` / `expected_utility()` — transition dynamics

## Notes

- Terminal-state utilities stay fixed at their assigned rewards.
- The policy grid includes a label for every non-terminal coordinate, including the blocked coordinate. Since that cell cannot be entered, its displayed action is not part of the reachable environment.
